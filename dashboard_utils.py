# GDP Map Insights
## GDP per capita
### The South Cone
One of the first conclutions one can arrive after a glance to this map is the importance of the South Cone 
from a GDP per capita perspective. Argentina, Chile and Uruguay have had an outstanding performance on this
indicator at least since th beginning of the 1990s. Driven by higher levels of industrialization -or in other
words, a greater relative autonomy from the income \ndirectly obtained through the explotation of their natural 
resources-, services supply and investment standards, along with better ratings on human development, education
and infraestructure spread across their territories; these countries found their place as a spearhead for
socioeconomic progress in the region.
### The Andean Region
Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador (in this order) have some of the worst marks in the whole continent. Southwestern Colombia
could also be included in the region and its GDP per capita fluctuates around the average of the other three. Highly 
dependant on mineral extraction and primary production, high levels of poverty and unemployment, low degrees on quality
of life, education, and an anfovourable insertion in the world division of labour, the growth of the GDP per capita for
these countries ran under the average of the region, present numerous opportunities for improvement and provide the need
to question their historical and current models of economic development and social pregression.
### The Caribbean
